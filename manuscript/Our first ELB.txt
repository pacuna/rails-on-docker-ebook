# Our first ELB

Let's create an ELB for the MySQL container. Remember to change the subnet and the
security group with your default or custom vpc information. This is going to be an internal ELB
since we just want to use it inside of our vpc network:

    $ aws elb create-load-balancer --load-balancer-name mysql-elb --listeners Protocol=TCP,LoadBalancerPort=80,InstanceProtocol=TCP,InstancePort=3306 --subnets subnet-39706b4e --scheme internal --security-groups sg-c70ff2a1

Output:

    {
	"DNSName": "internal-mysql-elb-1700927984.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
    }

The output gives us the endpoint for the database server. We will use this 
address in the Rails database configuration. This ELB will point to an EC2 
instance running a MySQL container that exposes and binds its port 3306 to the host.
On the other side, the ELB has a listener on its port 80 to the port 3306 of the instance, 
so if we want to connect to this ELB, remember to always use the port 80.

Finally, hosts outside of the vpc won't be able to connect to this ELB
since it was launched inside of our vpc using its default security group,

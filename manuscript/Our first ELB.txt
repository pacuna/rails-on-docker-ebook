# Our first ELB

The way we are going to manage Service Discovery inside ECS is by using Elastic 
Load Balancers for our resources. As I mentioned before, we can run our tasks
by using services that run behind an ELB. This ELB will have a static DNS, so we don't
have to worry if the service runs the task on different instances during 
deployments.

Let's create an ELB for the MySQL container. For this, will need our subnet and
security group ids. Remember you can store these values into variables by using:

    $ read GroupId VpcId <<< $(aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-names default --query "SecurityGroups[*].{GroupId:GroupId,VpcId:VpcId}" --output=text)
    $ SubnetId=`aws ec2 describe-subnets --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VpcId" --query "Subnets[0].SubnetId" --output=text`

Now you can use `$GroupId`, `$VpcId` and `$SubnetId` inside of the AWS CLI commands.
This ELB just needs to be reached by our cluster instances, so it can be internal.
Also, the MySQL container will expose the port 3306, so we can add a listener to that port
but use the port 80 in our ELB.
The command for create this ELB is:

    $ aws elb create-load-balancer --load-balancer-name mysql-elb --listeners Protocol=TCP,LoadBalancerPort=80,InstanceProtocol=TCP,InstancePort=3306 --subnets $SubnetId --scheme internal --security-groups $GroupId

Output:

    {
	"DNSName": "internal-mysql-elb-1700927984.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
    }

The output gives us the endpoint for the database server. We will use this 
address in the Rails database configuration. This ELB will point to an EC2 
instance running a MySQL container that exposes and binds its port 3306 to the host.
On the other side, the ELB has a listener on its port 80 to the port 3306 of the instance, 
so if we want to connect to this ELB, remember to always use the port 80.

Finally, hosts outside of the VPC won't be able to connect to this ELB
since it was launched inside of our VPC using its default security group.

Now, let's use the Web Console for this.
Go to the EC2 panel, and in the left sidebar, click on Load Balancers.
Then click on "Create Load Balancer":

Give the ELB a name, choose your default VPC and select the insternal
load balancer option. Also, add a listener from the port 80 of the ELB, 
to the port 3306 of the instance and click on "Next: Assign Security Groups":

In the security group configuration, make sure you select the default
VPC security Group and click next:

Click next until you reach the Review and Create button.
Verify that all it's correct:

And click create.

# Setting up the project

This is not a book about Ruby on Rails development, so we are not going to
build an application from scratch. Instead, we're going to deploy an application
obtainer from the [elasticsearch-rails gem repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-rails).
This a fully working example of a Rails application that uses elasticsearch
as a search engine.
Our final application is going to look like this:

![Complete Web Application](images/complete-app.png)

It's basically a search application that has several articles from the New York Times
which are persisted in a database and indexed in elasticsearch.
This application is distributed in several Rails templates, and since we need
to modify some things in order to dockerize the application, I've created a repository
with the final application. I've justed some minor modifications so all the hooks
with the dependencies are ready.

First, clone the repository in your local machine:

    git clone git@github.com:pacuna/searchapp.git

Now you'll have access to all the necessary files for deploying the application
with Amazon ECS. You'll find all this files in the deploy folder.

You're also going to need an Amazon AWS account and a DockerHub account, so
if you don't have one of those, now is the time to create it.
Once you have your DockerHub account ready, create a new public repository and name it
"youruser/searchapp". We are going to push our container images to that repository in order
to pull it from ECS.
For pushing the images to DockerHub you'll need Docker installed on your machine. It doesn't
matter is you are using native Docker, Vagrant, boot2docker, or Docker Toolbox. We just need
Docker connected to your DockerHub account.

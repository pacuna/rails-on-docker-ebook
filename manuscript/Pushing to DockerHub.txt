# Pushing the image to DockerHub

Now that we've test our application, let's push it to DockerHub.
From inside the Virtual Machine run:

    $ docker login

Use your DockerHub account information. This information will be saved on the system for posterior use.
Now, let's build and push the image.
In the root of the project run:

    docker build -t yourusername/searchapp:1.0

This command will build and tag the image that contains the application. It can take several minutes
the first time.
Once it's finishes, push the image to DockerHub:

    docker push yourusername/searchapp:1.0

If you have any errors during this step, it's probably because you haven't created the DockerHub repository yet or your
credentials are incorrect.

Now if you visit your repositories page in DockerHub, you should see
the project with its respective tag.
